# Iranian Bushwalkers

## Our Story

The Iranian Bushwalkers founded on January 10, 2013 \(an affiliate of Bushwalking Victoria\) is the first Bushwalking group for Iranian residents of Victoria. It is also opened to residents of all nationalities. It is a fantastic model that gets groups of Iranian-born residents to come out and enjoy safe, planned activities within parks around Melbourne and Victoria. It also organises other social activities like monthly book review sessions, monthly movie review sessions, seminars, etc.
